        <section class="problem">
          <h3 class="section-title">Problem</h3>
          <p class="section-text">Most cloud storage services have become too complicated for your average user to benefit from its features. The complexity of those features also makes navigation and organization a pain for professionals. Cloud World seeks to give a user-friendly experience regardless of the level of use.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="solution">
          <h3 class="solution-section-title">Solution</h3>
          <p class="solution-section-text">Through in-depth user research, competitive analysis, testing, and prototyping, I was able to create Cloud World. The design process found that users ultimately wanted all the expected cloud service capabilities but with none of the clutter.</p>

        <section class="competitive-analysis">
          <h3 class="section-title">Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <p class="section-text">In order to see how a new entity could enter a crowded marketplace, I needed to check out some of the leaders of the cloud service world. After playing around with Google Drive, Dropbox, and Pinterest, I began to notice how confusing it was getting while navigating or organizing my own files. This was my first signal that despite all the features, it wouldn't matter if the user had trouble getting to all of them.</p>

          <h3 class="section-title">User Survey</h3>
          <p class="section-text">I created a survey and sent it out to family, friends, and various social channels to get a good idea of my target audience. I found that navigation and visual appeal were recurring issues.</p>

          <p class="section-text">My personas focused on two different groups: working professionals and casual users such as students. Both sides seek an easy-to-use service that fulfills their needs in the most efficient way.</p>

          <h3 class="section-title">User Stories</h3>
          <p class="section-text">With a better understanding of what users were looking for, I was able to narrow my focus by creating user stories to see what tasks were to be part of the solution.</p>

        <section class="wireframes">
          <h3 class="section-title">Wireframes</h3>
          <p class="section-text">I tried to step away from the typical visual structure of a cloud storage service. I opted for a more minimalist approach and depended on images and icons rather than lists or grids. I began by sketching out my user flows and eventually created wireframes to start giving Cloud World an identity.</p>

          <h3 class="section-title">Usability Tests</h3>
          <p class="section-text">Once finished with the wireframes, I ran some tests to see how users would respond to a radical change in layout for a cloud storage service. Many changes were made but the positive response on the user-friendliness made me continue my visual ideas.</p>

          <h3 class="section-title">Mockups & Prototype v.1</h3>
          <p class="section-text">My initial mockups contained a lot of my ideas on color contrasting and ways to draw attention to certain elements. However I soon found out that I had oversized many parts and had not made a good use of whitespace.</p>

        <section class="preference-testing">
          <h3 class="section-title">Preference Testing</h3>
          <p class="section-text">I decided to run some preference tests on major parts of the site to see if users agreed with coloring decisions as well as the placement or use of certain images. This is where I received confirmation that whitespace and allowing my design to breath was a huge necessity.</p>

          <h3 class="section-title">Mockups & Prototype v.2</h3>
          <p class="section-text">My second round of mockups tried a more simplistic approach with the exclusion of excess coloration to attract attention. However my designs still had the issue of unnecessarily large elements.</p>

          <h3 class="section-title">Usability Testing</h3>
          <p class="section-text">The user tests I conducted by now focused less on aesthetics and more on functionality. The biggest change being to the storage view as I decided it was better to display more information to the user rather than to be stubborn about keeping the rotating/side-scrolling feature I had initially wanted.</p>

        <section class="cloud-world-ending">
          <h3 class="section-title">Cloud World</h3>
          <p class="section-text">My mockups went through more iterations towards the later stages as I sought a balance in functionality and visual contrast. My attempts of having less color caused a visibility issue for the logo and buttons. The biggest change was to the dashboard which saw the removal of the revolving feature and condensed all sections into one screen for easier access. This was an immense improvement to the navigation and sizing problems that haunted me from the beginning.</p>

        <section class="conclusion">
          <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
          <p class="section-text">The entire creation of Cloud World was a huge learning experience for me. My attempts of going away from what was considered the norm for cloud storage services was a major contributor to many mistakes I made. I did not consider how changing a tried-and-true layout and navigational procedure could affect the user's experience so much. However it was because of those challenges that I ran into that made me push the project to completion after numerous iterations and additional rounds of testing.</p>
