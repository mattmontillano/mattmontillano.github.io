          <p class="section-text" style="color:#fafafa">My mockups went through more iterations as I sought a balance in functionality and visual design. The biggest change was to the dashboard which saw the removal of the revolving feature and condensed all sections into one screen for easier access. This was an immense improvement to the navigation and sizing problems that remained from the beginning.</p>

          <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
          <p class="section-text">The creation of Cloud World was a huge learning experience for me. My attempts of going away from the norm for cloud storage services was the main contributor to many mistakes I made. I did not consider how changing standard layouts and navigation could affect the user's experience so much. However it was because of those challenges that made me push the project to completion after additonal iterations and rounds of testing.</p>
