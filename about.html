      <!-- About Section 2 -->

          <div class="about-section2-text-container">
            <h1 class="about-section2-title">Where It All Began</h1>
            <p class="about-section2-text1">If you asked me what introduced me to design, I’d have a hard time answering because how could I say I even knew what the word “design” meant when I was 5 years old, 10 years old, 18 years old, or even an entire year ago. But if I had to pick one particular thing, it wouldn’t be “what” introduced me to design, but “who”. My parents were assembly and factory workers when I was growing up so I never really felt their professions truly reflected who they were as people. But when I was around 7 years old (or whatever 2nd grade for me was), I remember seeing my mom draw small pictures on our kitchen table while she was doing “adult-things” that I can only assume were bills or balancing her checkbook now that I unfortunately know what “adult-things” pertain to. She would draw flowers, chairs, houses, and other doodles which I would later learn were things she wanted to make one day (and some of which she actually would). I was told I learned quickly from watching and proof of this came from me drawing things during class that I saw my mom draw herself. One day I drew my mom’s flower, almost exactly the way she did and some of my classmates saw and asked if I could draw things for them. I remember this vividly because a girl I had a small crush on was one of the first to ask me. The last part of this story I remember is telling my mom and older sister that I liked art and what were some other things I could draw. Their answer is what stuck with me till now: draw things that you would want to see one day.
            </p>
            <p class="about-section2-text2">What I found out about design for me is that it gives purpose to art but also allows science to paint a picture. I always found learning in school interesting but never enough to love the core subjects. On the flip side I always loved the creative freedom given in elective classes like art, wood shop, or photography but was always deterred by my parents and peers to pursue those any further. When I learned that design was the process of creating something for a specific reason, it gave me a solid foundation to believe that being creative could be just as important of a trait to have as any and that belief more than anything gave me hope that I could find something that I actually wanted to do. To me, design is the perfect middle ground of intellectual and creativity which just so happens to be exactly where I prefer to stand.

            <h1 class="about-section3-title1">Why I Do It</h1>
            <p class="about-section3-text1">I feel like design is all about making a difference; changing something to be perceived as something else. Whether it be to solve a problem or to evoke a feeling, I believe design is ultimately meant to cause a difference from one state of being to another for a person or group of people. A great example of this was clear to me in the industry I’ve worked in the past few years. If you are at all familiar with escape rooms, then you’ll know exactly what I’m about to talk about. And if you have no idea what those are, then I highly recommend grabbing some friends and go do one. But for 4 years I’ve been working at an escape room company with the great privilege of aiding in the design of them for the past 2 years as the manager. Working with the owner to create an experience for a group of people to entertain and challenge them for a complete hour has been a rollercoaster. From learning the psychology of creating puzzles to the countless mistakes I made in prop placement and set design were just some of the things that I encountered in the design process of an escape room. But the end result of being able to watch complete strangers have an unforgettable time in something you helped design was how I knew I made a difference.

            <h1 class="about-section3-title2">Adventure Is Out There</h1>
            <p class="about-section3-text2">When I’m not busy creating on my MacBook, I have a large pool of interests to choose from. From sports to board games and nights out on the town to binge watching Netflix (and now Disney+); I consider myself highly versatile which makes it easier for friends to choose things to do. Currently trying to learn Japanese and plan out my next trip. Here’s me with a new friend during my last trip to Thailand.
