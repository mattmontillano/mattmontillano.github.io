            <h1 class="about-section2-title">Beginnings</h1>
            <p class="about-section2-text1">It wouldn’t be “what” introduced me to design, but “who”. My parents worked tough jobs when I was growing up and I never felt their professions reflected their personalities. My mom would draw in our kitchen while she was doing “adult-things” when I was younger. She would sketch flowers, houses, and other doodles that I would learn were things she wanted to make one day (and some of which she actually would). I learned quickly from watching and told my mom that I liked art. I couldn't think of what to draw one day and I remember asking my mom for help. Her answer stuck with me till now: "draw things that you would want to see".
            </p>
            <p class="about-section2-text2">What I found out about design for me is that it gives purpose to creativity. I always gravitated towards the creative classes in school when I was younger but was constantly told by my parents not to pursue those. Realizing that design was a form of problem-solving gave me the strong belief that being creative was useful for myself but also for others.

            <h1 class="about-section3-title1">Design To Me</h1>
            <p class="about-section3-text1">I believe design is about making a positive difference. Whether it be to solve a problem or to evoke a feeling, design is meant to create change for people. For the past 4 years I’ve been working at an escape room company and have contributed towards the designs of every game. Creating intricate experiences that challenge customers has been a valuable lesson. However, being able to see others enjoy something I helped design was the most rewarding part.

            <h1 class="about-section3-title2">Adventure Is Out There</h1>
            <p class="about-section3-text2">I definitely have a large pool of interests to choose from. From sports to board games and nights out to binge watching Netflix (and now Disney+); I consider myself extremely versatile. Currently trying to learn Japanese and plan out my next trip. Here’s a picture of me with a friend during my last trip to Thailand!
